## Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms are fundamental for arranging data in a specific order, which is essential for the efficient operation of other algorithms. This section includes:

- **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Quick Sort**: An efficient, comparison-based, divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays based on whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

Other included sorting algorithms:
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort
- Radix Sort

## Data Structures

Data structures are critical for organizing and storing data efficiently. This section covers:

- **Arrays**: A collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
- **Linked Lists**: A linear data structure where each element is a separate object, containing data and a reference to the next node.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Linear data structures that follow LIFO (Last In First Out) and FIFO (First In First Out) principles, respectively.
- **Hash Tables**: Data structures that map keys to values using a hash function.
- **Trees and Graphs**: Hierarchical and network structures that store data in non-linear forms.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. This concept includes:

- **Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)**: Allows a class to have more than one method with the same name but different parameters.
- **Run-time Polymorphism (Method Overriding)**: Allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.

## Inheritance

Inheritance enables a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. Types of inheritance covered include:

- **Single Inheritance**: A class inherits from one superclass.
- **Multiple Inheritance**: A class inherits from more than one superclass.
- **Multilevel Inheritance**: A class inherits from a class, which in turn inherits from another class.
- **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple classes inherit from one superclass.
- **Hybrid Inheritance**: A combination of two or more types of inheritance.

## Algorithms on Graphs

Graph algorithms are essential for solving problems related to network structures. This section includes:

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures by exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: An algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.

Other included graph algorithms:
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- A* Search Algorithm
- Kruskal’s Algorithm
- Prim’s Algorithm
- Bellman-Ford Algorithm
